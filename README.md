# fyp-dev-build #

Version control for FYP dev build.

Proof of development for my 2015 final year project at the University of Leeds.

The prototype is coded to work within the /www folder of a local development environment and will require changes to hyperlinks if paths are altered.

Development of this software product has taken place entirely in a local development environment using using Apache, MySQL, phpMyAdmin and the localhost/ URL.

Summary of contents:

/views - Contains all .php files that create the webpages of the prototype

/css - Contains prototype style.css and a copy of the existing ABSP website norm.css

/js - Contains scripts for jQuery and DataTables

/images - Contains assets for the prototype and profile-pics sub-folder which stores player profile images

/scripts - Contains script files for populating absporgu_membership database. Database must exist for the scripts tp work. All script files were provided by Derek Sergeant on behalf of the ABSP
